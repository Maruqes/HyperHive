# Extra Install (Isolated Network + DHCP/NAT)
Choose this mode when the master must also provide an isolated `512rede` network with DHCP/NAT.

## Prerequisites
- Master: Fedora Server 38+ (SELinux enforcing) with VT-x/AMD-V, ≥8 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD, two NICs (management + `512rede`).
- Slaves: meet Normal mode requirements.
- Dedicated switch for `512rede`, no other DHCP servers on that segment.
- HyperHive repo available on all nodes, `sudo` access, maintenance window.

## Step-by-step
1. **Reset & install on master (destructive).**
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/all/install.sh
   ```
   Confirm `YES` and `I UNDERSTAND`. This wipes master VM definitions, libvirt networks, and NFS exports before reinstalling packages.

2. **Reset & install on any slave that needs the full stack.**
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/all/install.sh
   ```
   Run sequentially per slave; only execute on hosts you intend to reset.

3. **Rename the isolated NIC to `512rede` (master + every LAN-connected slave).**
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/all/change_interface_name.sh <current-nic-name>
   ```
   Replace `<current-nic-name>` with the detected interface (e.g., `enp7s0`). On the master execute this step **before** running the DHCP setup; then repeat on each slave that connects to the isolated LAN so all nodes present the interface as `512rede`. The script makes the rename persistent via systemd/udev. After renaming on every slave, bring the NetworkManager connection up and mark it for autostart so the node actually requests a lease from the master’s DHCP service:
   ```bash
   sudo nmcli con up 512rede              # or the connection name created by the script
   sudo nmcli connection modify 512rede connection.autoconnect yes
   ```
   For the host itself (master and slaves) to share the same L2 domain as the VMs that use `<interface type='direct'>`, create the macvtap companion interface:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/master/create_macvtap.sh --persist 512rede 512rede-host
   ```
   Slaves that should obtain an address from the master can then request one with:
   ```bash
   sudo dhclient 512rede-host
   ```

4. **Configure DHCP/NAT for `512rede` (master).**
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/master/setup_dhcp.sh <wan-interface>
   ```
   Supply the upstream/WAN NIC (e.g., `enp1s0`). The script now auto-creates (or refreshes) the macvtap child `512rede-host`, assigns `192.168.76.1/24`, writes the `dnsmasq` config, enables masquerading, and starts `dnsmasq-512rede-host.service`.

5. **Enable root SSH where needed.**
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/all/allow_root_ssh.sh
   ```
   Run on master/slaves requiring root login. Immediately enforce firewall restrictions or key-based auth.

6. **Verify services and networking.**
   ```bash
   systemctl status dnsmasq-512rede-host libvirtd nfs-server
   ip addr show 512rede-host
   ss -lupn | grep -E ':67|:53'
   ```
   Confirm DHCP/NAT, virtualization, and NFS are active; ensure `512rede-host` carries `192.168.76.1/24`.

## Tips
- Before Step 4 capture current interface names with `ip -o link show`.
- Use `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` temporarily if NAT testing is needed before running the DHCP script.
- Re-running `install.sh` requires repeating Steps 3–5 because configuration is reset.

## Next Steps
Configure `.env` values and PM2 autostart using `RUNTIME-SETUP.md`.
