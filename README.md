# HyperHive
Choose the right install guide, follow the runtime setup, and make sure required ports stay open—especially when slaves sit outside the LAN.

## Installation Guides
- [Solo Install](SOLO-INSTALL.md) — single node hosts every role.
- [Normal Install](NORMAL-INSTALL.md) — one master plus several slaves on the same network.
- [Extra Install](EXTRA-INSTALL.md) — master also serves the isolated `512rede` network.

## After Installation
- [Runtime Configuration & Autostart](RUNTIME-SETUP.md) — configure `.env`, build binaries, and register PM2 services.

## Network Ports
- `50051` — master gRPC endpoint.
- `50052` — slave gRPC endpoint.

If a slave lives outside the internal network, ensure these ports are reachable through firewalls/VPNs and adjust NAT rules as needed.

### Exposing Extra Ports
When adding new listeners (for example, a Minecraft server proxied by NPM) make sure both Docker and the host firewall allow the traffic.

1. Update `master/docker-compose.yml`:
   - For services without `network_mode: "host"`, extend the `ports` section (e.g. `- "25565:25565"`).
   - With host networking, skip port mappings and just configure the stream/virtual host inside NPM.
   - Apply the change: `docker compose -f master/docker-compose.yml up -d`.
2. Open the port in `firewalld` on the zone bound to the NIC (`sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones` shows the mapping). Example:
   - `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=25565/tcp --permanent`
   - (Optional) add UDP if needed, then reload: `sudo firewall-cmd --reload`.
   - Confirm: `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --list-ports`.
3. Re-test from outside the host (`nc -zv <host-ip> 25565`) and verify traffic reaches the service.
